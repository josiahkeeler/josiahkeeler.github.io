Welcome to the first dev log! I will be trying to keep to track of the work I do every day and what I learned. Useful links, cool stuff I found, eureka moments. Hopefully I find a better way to automate the process of creating these files, but for now a simple bash script will work.

My inspiration for using Markdown was from this [blog post](https://codeburst.io/vs-code-extensions-that-make-me-fall-love-in-programming-each-day-ccf05b24651e) on amazing VSCode extensions. One extension, [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced), let's me view my formatting in real time. I learned all my Markdown formatting from Reddit. Time to put it to good use.

Just finished my 42 project **Netwhat**, a 10 minute test on computer networking. Super easy stuff. I learned how to calculate subnet masks on the binary level. It's way more satisfying than using the [calculator](http://jodies.de/ipcalc) that most people use. Fun fact, *modem* stands for *"modulator demodulator"*. I would never have looked that up if it wasn't for this project. Big thanks to [michaelgiraldo](https://github.com/michaelgiraldo) for his prep sheet. Couldn't have done it without him.

Peace out!
