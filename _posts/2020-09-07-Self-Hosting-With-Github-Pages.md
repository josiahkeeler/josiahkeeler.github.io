Have you ever tried Wordpress? Cool platform, but it's so 2016. Real bloggers use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for it's speed and reliability. You don't have to worry about updating plugins or optimizing your webpage. Everything is statically generated from Markdown and YML. The default Github Jekyll format is fine if you want only one one webpage, but once I started adding more posts I quickly realized how limited it was. Time to install a full Jekyll instance!

Luckily, people have already done most of the work. I simply forked [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) which sets up a fully customized Jekyll website. Added some links to my social media *(follow me or else)*, created a blog post, and BOOM a professional looking blog that is fast, responsive, and very easy to set up. Sure, editing a text file to add images isn't as pretty as a full graphical interface, but it's definitely faster. And it's way better than the last posting system I made. Posting here also adds to my commit history so when people check my profile I look like a *hardworking programmer*.

As for actual school related activity, I'm still waiting on getting my work graded. I need one more evaluation to get my test results back. Started work on Get Next Line, an absolute beast of a C programming project. **tl;dr** it reads a text file line by line, always stopping when it finds a new line. I make it sound easy, don't I? Just wait, I'll be ranting about all my problems in a few days. The life of a programmer :)

Peace Out!
