I was looking at buying an [Alan Walker facemask](https://www.airinum.com/products/urban-air-mask-2-0-limited-alan-walker?variant=21177219121257) but was stopped by high prices and no stock. Even though I couldn't add any masks to my cart, I could still increment the quantity of masks I wanted and preview the total cost. After clicking the add button several hundred times, I decided to see how many masks I could add before the website would crash. Turns out, a lot. I left an autoclicker running overnight and woke up to this.

Nothing harmful. I just crashed the site for myself. However, after some more experimentation, I found out you could have negative item quantities! ![Wow.](/images/alan-owes.png)

Ultimately, nothing came out of this because I was unable to add the items to my cart. If you want to try breaking a shopping website for fun, mess with [Juice Shop](https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com/#/). The website was specifically created to teach the fundamentals of website exploits. Good luck and have fun! I know I will.

Peace out!
