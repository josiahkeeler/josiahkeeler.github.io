*The blue glow of a monitor. The click clack of keys on a keyboard. Surrounded by nothing but endless lines of code and only limited by the imagination.*

Most of the programming I do is usually late at night. That's when a lot of computer geeks are active. For me, it's partly necessity and partly bad time management. If you're a night owl, coding in pitch black at midnight is probably enjoyable. I'm the opposite. I love early mornings. Coding is my cup of coffee. 

Due to my job schedule, I've fallen off track my early morning adventures. Blue light exposure from my monitor is also not helping my sleep schedule. I really want to start waking up early again, but I need to break the cycle of staying up late and waking up late. Wish me luck! Time management has always been my weakness. That's why I'm encouraging myself to write a post every day. *Yay! Self improvement!*

Peace Out!
